<h1>Solution explanation</h1>
<p>First the down payment has to be calculated. It is a given percentage from the car's value. This is the initial tax which the user has to pay.</p>
<p>After that we are going to calculate the monthly lease. This is how much the user has to pay each month. We are going to use the following formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P = Principal amount (total lease amount, which is the vehicle price minus any down payment)</li>
  <li>r = Monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 100, then divided by 12)</li>
  <li>n = Number of monthly payments</li>
</ul>
<p>Next the total lease will be calculated by multiplying the monthly lease by the number of monthly payments and then we will add the down payment.</p>
